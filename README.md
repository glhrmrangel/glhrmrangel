### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Guilherme, but most people call me Rangel! I am a developer with a huge love for game development and technologies in general, very adaptable, and eager to learn.

I have been working in IT since 2019 and with development since 2021, having earned experiences in great multinational and multicultural companies.

I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and currently am enrolled in a Postgraduate Program in Distributed Software Architecture!

I am a developer focused mainly on Back-End, with the desire to move to full-stack eventually, as well as becoming somewhat of a Software Architect.
